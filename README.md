# char-cycler

This project aims to ease and speed up the typing of accented and upper case letters. The former will be done by pressing the same letter repeatedly, while the latter is done by holding that same letter. This eliminates the need for modifier keys (eg: Ctrl, Alt, Shift, etc), limiting all the typing to the main QWERTY layout.

Below are the default cycles:

> "c" key : [c, ç]

  "a" key : [a, á, à, ã, â]

  "e" key : [e, é, ê]

  "i" key : [i, í]

  "u" key : [u, ú]
